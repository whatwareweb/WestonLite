# WestonLite
Super lightweight configuration for Weston window manager and select programs.

This config is designed to be as usable and aesthetically pleasing as possible with the limitations of the Weston window manager. Since Weston doesn't support many features of other window managers such as custom keybinds or the wl-layer-shell protocol, maany expected features from a window manager might be missing. This was made to be more of a challenge project than a daily driver desktop.

Made for Hack Club's [Riceathon](https://github.com/hackclub/riceathon)

The components of the theming are the [Crystal Remix icon theme](https://github.com/dangvd/crystal-remix-icon-theme), Oxygen Bluecurve cursor theme, a customized [Skeuos Dark](https://github.com/daniruiz/skeuos-gtk) purple GTK theme (#3c1975 and #9758fc), and the [Kode Mono](https://github.com/isaozler/kode-mono) font, which is used globally.

Move all the directories into your home directory. Dconf editing may be required to set up the GTK themes and cursor themes and stuff
